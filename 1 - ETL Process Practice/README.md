# ETL Process Practice

## Overview

This project focuses on practicing the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python. The goal is to implement extraction, transformation, and loading functions for different data formats.

## Task Description

The task involves working with data available in CSV, JSON, and XML formats, with four headers: 'car_model', 'year_of_manufacture', 'price', and 'fuel'. The specific tasks are as follows:

1. **Extraction**: Implement the extraction process for the CSV, JSON, and XML files.

2. **Transformation**: Transform the values under the 'price' header such that they are rounded to 2 decimal places.

3. **Loading**: Implement the loading function to save the transformed data to a target file named 'transformed_data.csv'.

4. **Logging**: Implement the logging function for the entire process and save it in 'log_file.txt'.
